  abstract = {In the past two decades, meshfree methods have emerged into a new class of computational methods with considerable success. In addition, a significant amount of progress has been made in addressing the major shortcomings that were present in these methods at the early stages of their development. For instance, essential boundary conditions are almost trivial to enforce by employing the techniques now available, and the need for high order quadrature has been circumvented with the development of advanced techniques, essentially eliminating the previously existing bottleneck of computational expense in meshfree methods. Given the proper treatment, nodal integration can be made accurate and free of spatial instability, making it possible to eliminate the need for a mesh entirely. Meshfree collocation methods have also undergone significant development, which also offer a truly meshfree solution. This paper gives an overview of many classes of meshfree methods and their applications, and several advances are described in detail.},

This method is motivated by the theory of wavelets and also has the desirable attributes of the recently proposed smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH) methods, moving least squares methods (MLSM), diffuse element methods (DEM) and element-free Galerkin methods (EFGM). The proposed method maintains the advantages of the free Lagrange or SPH methods; however, because of the addition of a correction function, it gives much more accurate results. Therefore it is called the reproducing kernel particle method (RKPM). In computer implementation RKPM is shown to be more efficient than DEM and EFGM. Moreover, if the window function is C{$\infty$}, the solution and its derivatives are also C{$\infty$} in the entire domain. Theoretical analysis and numerical experiments on the 1D diffusion equation reveal the stability conditions and the effect of the dilation parameter on the unusually high convergence rates of the proposed method. Two-dimensional examples of advection-diffusion equations and compressible Euler equations are also presented together with 2D multiple-scale decompositions.},

  abstract = {We present a method to process embedded smooth manifolds using sets of points alone. This method avoids any global parameterization and hence is applicable to surfaces of any genus. It combines three ingredients: (1) the automatic detection of the local geometric structure of the manifold by statistical learning methods; (2) the local parameterization of the surface using smooth meshfree (here maximumentropy) approximants; and (3) patching together the local representations by means of a partition of unity. Mesh-based methods can deal with surfaces of complex topology, since they rely on the element-level parameterizations, but cannot handle high-dimensional manifolds, whereas previous meshfree methods for thin shells consider a global parametric domain, which seriously limits the kinds of surfaces that can be treated. We present the implementation of the method in the context of Kirchhoff\textendash Love shells, but it is applicable to other calculations on manifolds in any dimension. With the smooth approximants, this fourth-order partial differential equation is treated directly. We show the good performance of the method on the basis of the classical obstacle course. Additional calculations exemplify the flexibility of the proposed approach in treating surfaces of complex topology and geometry. Copyright ᭧ 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {A rotation-free Hellinger-Reissner meshfree thin plate formulation is proposed to naturally accommodate the essential boundary conditions in a variationally consistent way. In this approach, the Galerkin weak form is established based upon the Hellinger-Reissner variational principle, where the bending moment is expressed as the second order smoothed gradients which inherently embed the integration constraint and fulfill the variational consistency condition. Owing to the Hellinger-Reissner variational principle, the essential boundary conditions naturally arise in the weak form. Accordingly, the enforcement of essential boundary conditions has a similar form as that of the Nitsche's method, i.e., both have standard consistent and stabilized terms. Compared with the Nitsche's method, the costly second and higher order derivatives of traditional meshfree shape functions are replaced by the fast-evaluated second order smoothed gradients and their derivatives. Meanwhile, the stabilized term in proposed method does not involve any artificial parameter and thus eliminates the stabilization parameter-dependent issue in the Nitsche's formulation. Several examples are presented to illustrate the convergence, accuracy and efficiency of the proposed rotation-free Hellinger-Reissner meshfree thin plate formulation.},
