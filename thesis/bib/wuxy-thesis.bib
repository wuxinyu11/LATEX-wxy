	abstract = {Abstract A new continuous reproducing kernel interpolation function which explores the attractive features of the flexible time-frequency and space-wave number localization of a window function is developed. This method is motivated by the theory of wavelets and also has the desirable attributes of the recently proposed smooth particle hydrodynamics ({SPH}) methods, moving least squares methods ({MLSM}), diffuse element methods ({DEM}) and element-free Galerkin methods ({EFGM}). The proposed method maintains the advantages of the free Lagrange or {SPH} methods; however, because of the addition of a correction function, it gives much more accurate results. Therefore it is called the reproducing kernel particle method ({RKPM}). In computer implementation {RKPM} is shown to be more efficient than {DEM} and {EFGM}. Moreover, if the window function is C∞, the solution and its derivatives are also C∞ in the entire domain. Theoretical analysis and numerical experiments on the 1D diffusion equation reveal the stability conditions and the effect of the dilation parameter on the unusually high convergence rates of the proposed method. Two-dimensional examples of advection-diffusion equations and compressible Euler equations are also presented together with 2D multiple-scale decompositions.},

	abstract = {无网格法具有高阶连续光滑的形函数, 在结构分析中呈现出显著的精度优势. 但无网格形函数在节点处一般没有插值性, 导致伽辽金无网格法难以直接施加本质边界条件. 采用变分一致尼兹法施加边界条件的数值解具有良好的收敛性和稳定性, 因而得到了非常广泛的应用, 然而该方法仍然需要引入人工参数来保证算法的稳定性. 本文以赫林格−赖斯纳变分原理为基础, 建立了一种变分一致的本质边界条件施加方法. 该方法采用混合离散近似赫林格−赖斯纳变分原理弱形式中的位移和应力, 其中位移采用传统无网格形函数进行离散, 而应力则在背景积分单元中近似为相应阶次的多项式. 此时的无网格离散方程可视为一种新型的尼兹法施加本质边界条件, 其中修正变分项采用再生光滑梯度和无网格形函数进行混合离散, 稳定项则内嵌于赫林格−赖斯纳变分原理弱形式中, 无需额外增加稳定项, 消除了对人工参数的依赖性. 该方法无需计算复杂耗时的形函数导数, 并满足积分约束条件, 保证了数值求解的精度. 数值结果表明, 所提方法能够保证伽辽金无网格法的计算精度最优误差收敛率, 与传统的尼兹法相比明显提高了计算效率.},

	abstract = {A rotation-free Hellinger-Reissner meshfree thin plate formulation is proposed to naturally accommodate the essential boundary conditions in a variationally consistent way. In this approach, the Galerkin weak form is established based upon the Hellinger-Reissner variational principle, where the bending moment is expressed as the second order smoothed gradients which inherently embed the integration constraint and fulfill the variational consistency condition. Owing to the Hellinger-Reissner variational principle, the essential boundary conditions naturally arise in the weak form. Accordingly, the enforcement of essential boundary conditions has a similar form as that of the Nitsche's method, i.e., both have standard consistent and stabilized terms. Compared with the Nitsche's method, the costly second and higher order derivatives of traditional meshfree shape functions are replaced by the fast-evaluated second order smoothed gradients and their derivatives. Meanwhile, the stabilized term in proposed method does not involve any artificial parameter and thus eliminates the stabilization parameter-dependent issue in the Nitsche's formulation. Several examples are presented to illustrate the convergence, accuracy and efficiency of the proposed rotation-free Hellinger-Reissner meshfree thin plate formulation.},

	abstract = {An element-free Galerkin method which is applicable to arbitrary shapes but requires only nodal data is applied to elasticity and heat conduction problems. In this method, moving least-squares interpolants are used to construct the trial and test functions for the variational principle (weak form); the dependent variable and its gradient are continuous in the entire domain. In contrast to an earlier formulation by Nayroles and coworkers, certain key differences are introduced in the implementation to increase its accuracy. The numerical examples in this paper show that with these modifications, the method does not exhibit any volumetric locking, the rate of convergence can exceed that of finite elements significantly and a high resolution of localized steep gradients can be achieved. The moving least-squares interpolants and the choices of the weight function are also discussed in this paper.},
